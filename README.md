# Graph_Database
Worked on making a graph database from scratch, which visualizes nodes and edges. Tried to create a similar graph database like Neo4j using Cypher-like query language.

## Detail
This project is written in Python using its various libraries. The aim was to create a graph database that adheres to all the rules of an advanced database management system like ACID, concurrency control, transaction management, optimized storage, and optimal query operations. Applied indexing for a quick searching task. The UI of the project was made in Streamlit.
